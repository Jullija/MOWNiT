## Computation Methods for Science and Technology 
Repository created for Computation Methods for Science and Technology at AGH. 
Most of the code is written in Julia using jupyter notebook.

### Issues raised:
- approximation (Pade, Taylor)
- Runge's phenomenom
- interpolation
- integrals
- orthogonality
- polynomial's roots
- factorization
